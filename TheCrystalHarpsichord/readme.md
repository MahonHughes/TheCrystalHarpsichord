# These are the instructions to compile *The Crystal Harpsichord*

**The project can be compiled using the command** `make run`
To compile without running, use command `make`

The following dependancies should also be installed:
 - portaudio
 - libsndfile
 - SDL2

These can be installed with:
```
brew install portaudio libsndfile sdl2
```

 If the solution will not compile, try running `make install` first and ensure you are compiling from the project directory.
